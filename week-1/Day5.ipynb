      "The industry today is constantly being disrupted by ever-changing consumer preferences and new technologies. Customers demand innovative products, which means producing a wider range of goods at higher volumes quickly. In developing markets, consumers are also spending more, which raises the call for an expanded supply chain.\n",
      "According to Allied Market Research, the global FMCG market is predicted to reach $15,361.8 billion by 2025, growing at an incredible 5.4% in the next five years. New avenues providing greater business opportunities. Research from Statista also shows that eCommerce is growing faster than traditional brick and mortar stores every year. Consumers are demanding new product offerings such as healthier and sustainable products, and this is expected to open new roads for FMCG players.\n",

Keep chemical inventories moving and costs in control with always-on digital visibility, a flexible mix of multimodal transport options and seamless end-to-end operations, so that you can go all the way.\n",
      "Industry overview\n",
      "In a world where 96% of all manufactured goods depend on chemicals in one way or another, there are ample opportunities for chemical companies to grow. Chemical manufacturers, striving to secure a larger share in the marketplace, have created an extremely competitive battleground. Several industry trends – protectionist trade policies, tariff wars, and industry consolidation – are also pushing businesses to adopt new ways to stand out.\n",
      "As these trends permeate the chemical industry, many businesses are remodelling to drive growth and profitability. At the core of this transformation is the need to build resilience - with the ability to adapt, digitise, and modernise. Safety remains a high priority while decarbonisation has increasingly become a focus.\n",
      "Chemical companies see their supply chains playing a crucial role in their business transformation. Whether they need to support continuous production lines with effective storage solutions; increase margins with supply chain cost-efficiencies; improve safety and compliance, or gain customer loyalty with greater visibility and on-time deliveries, they are making high demands of their supply chain partners to add value at every stage of their supply chain.\n",

      "End-to-end visibility is probably one of the biggest aspects that keeps automotive supply chains going. It holds the secret to tracking the flow of materials and components in real-time, improving efficiency, reducing risks, and enhancing customer satisfaction. This article dives into our partnership with Sazgar Engineering Works and how it helped overcome supply chain challenges and unlock operational efficiency.

      "Automotive supply chains have become even more complex. Today, the two drivetrains – internal combustion and electric – are sharing space on vehicle production lines. The epicentre of battery production has shifted to regional geographies, and technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are evolving at a pace that demands quick and seamless turnarounds.\n",
      "With increasing customer demands and expectations, more parts are going into vehicles than ever before. As a component manufacturer, you now face an inherent need to produce more components than the OEMs themselves.\n",
      "In the context of this industry-wide transformation, Antonio Fondevilla, Global Automotive Vertical Head of Maersk, explains the role that logistics can play in navigating this disruptive landscape.\n",
      "1:20\n",
      "Every component matters\n",
      "Tens of thousands of components – big and small – go into the marvel that is an automobile. This means that all the parts need to be in the right place at the right time. Delays are not acceptable as they risk slowing down the assembly line.\n",
      "To ensure that all your components move like clockwork, you need a logistics offering that gives you utmost control, reliability and transparency. From end to end, departure to destination, our automotive supply chain solutions are designed to give you just that.\n",
