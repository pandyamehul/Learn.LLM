      "Scientists photographed and filmed what looked like fields of marine life - dominated by various different types of tube worm and mollusc. These animals live in the pitch dark and under vast pressure.\n",
      "With no sunlight, life at these depths is fuelled by chemicals that seep out of the ocean floor. Hydrogen sulfide and methane seep out of faults - or cracks -  in the Earth's crust.\n",
      "The scientists say they have recorded species never seen before. In future studies, they hope to work out how the bodies of these so called \"chemosynthetic\" or chemical-fuelled creatures convert these chemicals into energy.\n",
