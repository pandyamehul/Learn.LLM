      "\"It's exciting - especially for a deep sea scientist - to go to a place that human beings have not explored,\" one of the lead researchers, Dr Xiaotong Peng, told BBC News. \"It's a great opportunity to discover new things. And what we saw was quite amazing.\"\n",
      "Scientists photographed and filmed what looked like fields of marine life - dominated by various different types of tube worm and mollusc. These animals live in the pitch dark and under vast pressure.\n",
      "With no sunlight, life at these depths is fuelled by chemicals that seep out of the ocean floor. Hydrogen sulfide and methane seep out of faults - or cracks -  in the Earth's crust.\n",
      "The scientists say they have recorded species never seen before. In future studies, they hope to work out how the bodies of these so called \"chemosynthetic\" or chemical-fuelled creatures convert these chemicals into energy.\n",
      "\"They must [also] have a trick to adapt to life in super high pressure,\" added Dr Megran Du, also from China's Institute of Deep Sea Science and Engineering. \"That's another question we need to answer.\"\n",

      "Beds of molluscs appear to rely on the chemical \"fuel\" that seeps out of the seabed\n",
      "The findings challenge \"long-standing assumptions\" about life's potential at such extreme depths and pressures. They also suggest that these communities of animals, rather than extreme rarities, are actually widespread.\n",
      "Prof Andrew Sweetman, a senior scientist from the Scottish Association for marine science told BBC News that the discovery showed that whole \"ecosystems driven by methane may exist in the deepest parts of the ocean\".\n",
      "And how did it feel, for a scientist, to descend to such extreme, pitch-black depths?\n",
